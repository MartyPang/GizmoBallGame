# GizmoBallGame
Gizmoball is a customizable pinball game. It's a course project from [MIT Laboratory in Software Engineering](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-170-laboratory-in-software-engineering-fall-2005/).

You can customize the positions of left and right flippers with key `W`/`A`/`S`/`D` and up/down/left/right. To spin two flippers, just hit `Z` and `M`.

The game can be manually archived to continue playing next to the direct read on the progress.
